# Cook Like a Dev


## Context

This is a frontend project for a web application that displays a collection of recipes for drinks and foods. The project features include displaying a list of drink and food recipes, allowing the user to filter recipes by category (drinks or foods), enabling the user to search for a specific recipe, displaying the details of a selected recipe, including the list of ingredients, step-by-step preparation, and other functions.

The project was made in collaboration with Anna Beatriz Trajano de SÃ¡, Lucas Mesquita, Mariah Manetti, and Rafael Friedel.
